            <p>I don't always code, but when I do I really like it. I love working with <b> Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Backbone, HTML, CSS, and Node.js</b>. I code for fun and for work, and most of the rest of the time. Ok, so maybe I do always code. I grew up in upstate New York, and moved to San Francisco to experience the exciting world of Tech where it is hottest. While here I have met a lot of great people and worked on some very cool projects, some of which are above.</p>


          <p>I have done quite a bit of pair programming with other developers, and the ability to talk through ideas and amalmagate several diverging paths of thought is a skill that I have slowly learned. I now have a good grasp on what it takes to work in collaboration with my friends/collegues and I enjoy the process from start to finish.</p>


          <p>If I had to describe myself as a coder in a word, it would be excited. I enjoy solving problems and working with other people, but more than anything, just building things. For some it is difficult to keep the payoff in mind while working on a bug, or cranking out boilerplate, but for me its motivation. That website or game or server that I am working on is worth whatever I have to do to make it fast, clean, and beautiful.</p>
